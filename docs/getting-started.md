## Claude Code Setup

This is for the **Claude Code CLI** (the terminal tool). If you want the Claude Desktop app extension, skip to [Claude Desktop Setup](#claude-desktop-setup) below.

### How It Works

The accessibility agents are installed as Claude Code agents with a three-hook enforcement gate. You do not need to invoke them manually. The hooks automatically detect web projects and block UI file edits until accessibility-lead has been consulted.

The enforcement flow:

1. **Proactive detection** — A `UserPromptSubmit` hook checks your project directory for web framework indicators (`package.json` with React/Next/Vue, config files, `.tsx`/`.jsx` files). In a web project, the delegation instruction fires on every prompt — even "fix the bug."
2. **Edit gate** — A `PreToolUse` hook blocks any Edit/Write to UI files (`.jsx`, `.tsx`, `.vue`, `.css`, `.html`, etc.) until the accessibility-lead agent has completed a review. The tool call is denied at the system level using `permissionDecision: "deny"`.
3. **Session marker** — A `PostToolUse` hook creates a session marker when accessibility-lead completes. This unlocks the edit gate for the rest of the session.

The team includes twenty-five agents: nine web code specialists that write and review code, six document accessibility specialists that scan Office and PDF files, one document accessibility wizard that runs guided document audits (with two hidden helper sub-agents for parallel scanning), one markdown documentation accessibility orchestrator (markdown-a11y-assistant) that audits .md files across nine accessibility domains (with two hidden helper sub-agents for parallel scanning and fix application), one orchestrator that coordinates them, one interactive wizard that runs guided web audits (with two hidden helper sub-agents for page crawling and parallel scanning), one testing coach that teaches you how to verify accessibility, and one WCAG guide that explains the standards themselves. Three reusable agent skills provide domain knowledge.

For tasks that do not involve UI code (backend logic, scripts, database work), the hooks stay silent and the agents are not invoked.

### Prerequisites

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Always use the **latest versions** of all tools. Accessibility Agents rely on current platform APIs, new capabilities, and bug fixes. Outdated tools may cause unexpected behavior or missing functionality.

**Required:**

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) CLI installed and working (latest version)
- A Claude Code subscription (Pro, Max, or Team)
- **macOS/Linux:** bash 4.0+ (pre-installed on modern systems)
- **Windows:** PowerShell 5.1+ (pre-installed on Windows 10/11)

**Version Checks:**

```bash
claude code --version    # Should show latest stable release
bash --version          # macOS/Linux only
```

**How to Update:**

```bash
# Update Claude Code CLI
claude code update

# Update Accessibility Agents
cd accessibility-agents
git pull origin main
bash update.sh
```

### Installation

#### One-Liner (Recommended)

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Community-Access/accessibility-agents/main/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Community-Access/accessibility-agents/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

The installer downloads the repo, copies agents, installs the three enforcement hooks to `~/.claude/hooks/`, registers them in `~/.claude/settings.json`, and optionally sets up daily auto-updates and GitHub Copilot agents. It will prompt you to choose project-level or global install.

**Non-interactive one-liners:**

```bash
# macOS/Linux - install globally, no prompts
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Community-Access/accessibility-agents/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --global

# macOS/Linux - install to current project, no prompts
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Community-Access/accessibility-agents/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --project

# macOS/Linux - install globally with Copilot agents
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Community-Access/accessibility-agents/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --global --copilot
```

#### From Cloned Repo

If you prefer to clone first:

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Community-Access/accessibility-agents.git
cd a11y-agent-team
bash install.sh
```

Pass flags to skip prompts: `--global`, `--project`, `--copilot`, `--codex`.

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Community-Access/accessibility-agents.git
cd a11y-agent-team
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File install.ps1
```

The `--copilot` flag installs the accessibility agents for GitHub Copilot Chat. For **global** installs, this copies `.agent.md` files directly into your VS Code user profile so the agents appear in the Copilot Chat agent picker across all workspaces. For **project** installs, it copies them into the project's `.github/agents/` directory.

To remove:

```bash
bash uninstall.sh
bash uninstall.sh --global    # Non-interactive global uninstall
bash uninstall.sh --project   # Non-interactive project uninstall
```

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File uninstall.ps1
```

#### Manual Setup

If you prefer to install manually or need to integrate into an existing configuration:

##### 1. Copy agents

```bash
# For project install
mkdir -p .claude/agents
cp -r path/to/a11y-agent-team/.claude/agents/*.md .claude/agents/

# For global install
mkdir -p ~/.claude/agents
cp -r path/to/a11y-agent-team/.claude/agents/*.md ~/.claude/agents/
```

##### 2. Copy enforcement hooks (global install only)

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/hooks
cp path/to/accessibility-agents/claude-code-plugin/scripts/a11y-team-eval.sh ~/.claude/hooks/
cp path/to/accessibility-agents/claude-code-plugin/scripts/a11y-enforce-edit.sh ~/.claude/hooks/
cp path/to/accessibility-agents/claude-code-plugin/scripts/a11y-mark-reviewed.sh ~/.claude/hooks/
chmod +x ~/.claude/hooks/a11y-*.sh
```

Then register the hooks in `~/.claude/settings.json` (see the [Hooks Guide](hooks-guide.md) for the full JSON).

##### 3. Verify

Start Claude Code and type `/agents`. You should see all agents listed. Then verify enforcement:

1. Open a web project (anything with `package.json` containing React/Next/Vue/etc.)
2. Type any prompt — you should see `DETECTED: This is a web project` in the system reminder
3. If Claude tries to edit a `.tsx` file without consulting accessibility-lead, it should be blocked with `BLOCKED: Cannot edit UI file...`

### Using the Agents in Claude Code

Invoke any agent by name using the slash command or `@` mention:

```text
/accessibility-lead full audit of the checkout flow
/aria-specialist review the ARIA in components/modal.tsx
/contrast-master check all color combinations in globals.css
/keyboard-navigator audit tab order on the settings page
/web-accessibility-wizard run a full guided accessibility audit
/document-accessibility-wizard audit all documents in the docs/ folder
/testing-coach how do I test this modal with NVDA?
/wcag-guide explain WCAG 1.4.11 non-text contrast
```

To see all installed agents at any time, type `/agents` in Claude Code.

### Verifying Installation with Agent Debug Panel (VS Code 1.110+)

**VS Code users:** Use the **Agent Debug Panel** to verify all agents loaded correctly and see the three-hook enforcement system in action.

**Open the panel:**

- Command Palette → "Developer: Open Agent Debug Panel"
- Or: Copilot Chat view gear icon → "View Agent Logs"

**Check that you see:**

- **80 agents loaded** across all agent teams (web, document, GitHub, developer tools)
- **25 active skills** providing domain knowledge
- **3 workspace instructions** (web-accessibility-baseline, semantic-html, aria-patterns or powershell-terminal-ops depending on platform)
- **Hook execution** showing UserPromptSubmit, PreToolUse, and PostToolUse events during web UI tasks

If agents are missing or hooks are not firing, see the [Agent Debug Panel Guide](guides/agent-debug-panel.md) for troubleshooting workflows.

### Global vs Project Install

**Project-level** (recommended for teams): Install to `.claude/` in each web project. Check into version control so your whole team benefits. The agents travel with the repo.

**Global** (recommended for individuals): Install to `~/.claude/` to have the team available across all your projects automatically. Nothing to configure per-project. One install covers everything.

You can use both. Project-level agents override global agents with the same name, so you could customize an agent for a specific project while keeping the defaults globally.

### Auto-Updates (Claude Code)

During global installation, the installer asks if you want to enable auto-updates. When enabled, a daily scheduled job checks GitHub for new agent versions and installs them automatically.

- **macOS:** Uses a LaunchAgent (`~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.community-access.a11y-agent-team-update.plist`), runs daily at 9:00 AM
- **Linux:** Uses a cron job, runs daily at 9:00 AM
- **Windows:** Uses Task Scheduler (`A11yAgentTeamUpdate`), runs daily at 9:00 AM

Auto-updates keep both Claude Code agents (`~/.claude/agents/`) and Copilot agents in your VS Code user profile folder in sync.

Update log is saved to `~/.claude/.a11y-agent-team-update.log`.

You can also run updates manually at any time:

macOS/Linux:

```bash
bash update.sh
```

Windows:

```powershell
powershell -File update.ps1
```

Auto-updates are fully removed when you run the uninstaller.

### OS Notifications for Long-Running Audits (VS Code 1.110+)

**VS Code users:** Configure OS notifications to stay informed during long-running accessibility audits, even when focused on other applications.

**Recommended Settings (VS Code):**

```jsonc
{
  // Notify when agent asks a question or needs confirmation
  "chat.notifyWindowOnResponseReceived": true,
  "chat.notifyWindowOnConfirmation": true,
  
  // Accessibility signal when user action is required
  "accessibility.signals.chatUserActionRequired": "on" // or "auto"
}
```

**When This Helps:**

- **Document audits:** Scanning 100+ Office or PDF files can take several minutes
- **Web wizard audits:** Multi-phase web accessibility workflows spanning 10+ minutes
- **GitHub briefings:** Background data collection across multiple repos
- **Long research phases:** Discovery and inventory building for cross-page analysis

**Accessibility Benefit:** Screen reader users hear an audio signal when an agent requires input, preventing missed questions during context switches.

**How to Configure:**

1. Open VS Code Settings (Ctrl/Cmd + ,)
2. Search for "chat notify"
3. Enable "Notify Window on Response Received" and "Notify Window on Confirmation"
4. Search for "accessibility signals chat"
5. Set "Chat User Action Required" to "on" or "auto"

### AI Co-Author Attribution (VS Code 1.110+)

**VS Code users:** Consider enabling AI co-author attribution to maintain transparency about AI contributions to your accessibility code.

**Recommended Setting:**

```jsonc
{
  // Add Co-authored-by: trailers to commits with AI-generated code
  "git.addAICoAuthor": "chatAndAgent"  // or "all" for completions too
}
```

**What It Does:**
Automatically adds a `Co-authored-by: GitHub Copilot <copilot@github.com>` trailer to git commit messages when code was generated or modified by AI agents.

**Benefits:**

- **Transparency:** Git history accurately reflects human + AI collaboration
- **Compliance:** Aligns with emerging AI attribution standards
- **Auditing:** Clear record of which accessibility fixes came from agents vs manual review

**Options:**

- `"chatAndAgent"` - Only for chat-generated and agent-generated code (recommended)
- `"all"` - Includes inline completions and suggestions
- `"never"` - No attribution (default)

**How to Configure:**

1. Open VS Code Settings (Ctrl/Cmd + ,)
2. Search for "git.addAICoAuthor"
3. Set to `"chatAndAgent"` or `"all"`

**Example Commit:**

```html
fix: Add ARIA labels to navigation menu controls

Co-authored-by: GitHub Copilot <copilot@github.com>
```

## GitHub Copilot Setup

This is for **GitHub Copilot Chat** in VS Code (or other editors that support the `.github/agents/` format).

### How It Works

GitHub Copilot supports custom agents via `.github/agents/*.agent.md` files and workspace-level instructions via `.github/copilot-instructions.md`. The A11y Agent Team provides:

- **Twenty-five specialist agents** that you can invoke by name in Copilot Chat
- **Workspace instructions** that remind Copilot to consider accessibility on every UI task
- **PR review instructions** (`.github/copilot-review-instructions.md`) that enforce accessibility standards during Copilot Code Review on pull requests
- **Commit message instructions** (`.github/copilot-commit-message-instructions.md`) that guide Copilot to include accessibility context in commit messages
- **PR template** (`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`) with an accessibility checklist for every pull request
- **CI workflow** (`.github/workflows/a11y-check.yml`) that runs automated accessibility checks on PRs
- **VS Code configuration** (`.vscode/`) with recommended extensions, settings, tasks, and MCP server config

The workspace instructions in `.github/copilot-instructions.md` are automatically loaded into every Copilot Chat conversation, ensuring accessibility guidance is always present.

### Prerequisites

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Always use the **latest versions** of VS Code and GitHub Copilot extensions. New features (browser tools, enhanced context, improved tool use) and bug fixes directly impact agent capabilities.

**Required:**

- [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) subscription (Individual, Business, or Enterprise)
- **VS Code:** Latest stable release ([Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
- **GitHub Copilot Extension:** Latest version from VS Code Marketplace
- **GitHub Copilot Chat Extension:** Latest version from VS Code Marketplace
- Agent mode and custom agents enabled in VS Code settings

**Version Checks:**

```bash
code --version    # Should show latest stable VS Code release
```

**How to Update:**

```bash
# Update VS Code: Help → Check for Updates
# Or enable auto-updates: File → Preferences → Settings → search "update mode"

# Update Extensions: Extensions → @installed → Update next to GitHub Copilot extensions

# Update Accessibility Agents
cd accessibility-agents
git pull origin main
bash update.sh
```

### Installation

#### Option 1: Global (via the installer)

The easiest way to get Copilot agents in every workspace.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Community-Access/accessibility-agents.git
cd a11y-agent-team
bash install.sh --global --copilot
```

This installs Copilot agents to your VS Code user profile folder. After installing, reload VS Code and open Copilot Chat. The agents will appear in the agent picker dropdown across all workspaces.

> **First use:** After installation, open the agent picker dropdown (the model/agent selector at the top of the Copilot Chat panel) and select the agent you want to use. Custom agents do not appear in `@` autocomplete until you have selected them from the picker at least once.

#### Option 2: Per-project

Copy the `.github` directory into your project so the agents travel with the repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Community-Access/accessibility-agents.git
cd a11y-agent-team
cp -r .github /path/to/your/project/
```

Or use the installer with the project flag:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
bash /path/to/a11y-agent-team/install.sh --project --copilot
```

#### Option 3: Per-project (via a11y-copilot-init)

If you installed globally with `--copilot`, run `a11y-copilot-init` inside any project to copy the agents:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
a11y-copilot-init
```

### Using the Agents in Copilot Chat

> **Important:** Custom agents must first be selected from the **agent picker dropdown** at the top of the Copilot Chat panel. They will not appear when typing `@` in the chat input until you have selected them from the picker at least once. This is standard VS Code behavior for custom agents, not specific to this project.

Once an agent has been picked, you can mention it by name to invoke it:

```text
@accessibility-lead full audit of the checkout flow
@aria-specialist review the ARIA in components/modal.tsx
@contrast-master check all color combinations in globals.css
@web-accessibility-wizard run a full guided accessibility audit of this project
@document-accessibility-wizard scan all documents in the docs/ folder
@testing-coach how should I test this component with VoiceOver?
@wcag-guide what changed between WCAG 2.1 and 2.2?
```

The workspace instructions in `.github/copilot-instructions.md` are loaded into every Copilot Chat conversation. When you ask Copilot to build or modify UI code, it will automatically consider accessibility requirements.

### Differences from Claude Code

| Feature | Claude Code | GitHub Copilot |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| Agent location | `.claude/agents/` | `.github/agents/` |
| Activation | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` |
| PR review | N/A | `.github/copilot-review-instructions.md` |
| Commit messages | N/A | `.github/copilot-commit-message-instructions.md` |

## GitHub Copilot CLI Setup

This is for **GitHub Copilot CLI** - the terminal-native agent interface. If you want the VS Code extension, see [GitHub Copilot Setup](#github-copilot-setup) above.

### How It Works

GitHub Copilot CLI is a standalone terminal application that runs Copilot directly in your shell. It supports custom agents via `.github/agents/*.agent.md` files and skills via `.github/skills/*/SKILL.md` folders.

The accessibility agents work in Copilot CLI with these capabilities:
- **Agent invocation** via `/agent` command or natural language
- **Skill loading** for domain-specific knowledge (accessibility rules, WCAG reference)
- **Tool access** for file reading, editing, searching, and command execution

### Prerequisites

**Required:**

- [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://docs.github.com/copilot/concepts/agents/about-copilot-cli) installed
- An active Copilot subscription
- **Windows:** PowerShell v6 or higher

**Installation:**

```bash
# npm (all platforms)
npm install -g @github/copilot

# Homebrew (macOS/Linux)
brew install copilot-cli

# WinGet (Windows)
winget install GitHub.Copilot
```

### Agent Discovery Paths

Copilot CLI discovers agents from these locations:

| Type | Path | Scope |
|------|------|-------|
| Repository | `.github/agents/*.agent.md` | Current project only |
| User | `~/.copilot/agents/*.agent.md` | All projects |
| Organization | `.github-private/agents/` | Organization-wide |

### Skill Discovery Paths

Skills provide domain knowledge that agents can load when relevant:

| Type | Path | Scope |
|------|------|-------|
| Repository | `.github/skills/*/SKILL.md` | Current project only |
| User | `~/.copilot/skills/*/SKILL.md` | All projects |

### Installation

#### Option 1: Repository-level (Per-project)

Clone or copy the accessibility agents into your project:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Community-Access/accessibility-agents.git

# Copy agents and skills to your project
cp -r accessibility-agents/.github/agents /path/to/your/project/.github/
cp -r accessibility-agents/.github/skills /path/to/your/project/.github/
```

#### Option 2: User-level (Global)

Install agents globally so they're available in all projects:

```bash
# Create directories if they don't exist
mkdir -p ~/.copilot/agents
mkdir -p ~/.copilot/skills

# Copy agents
cp accessibility-agents/.github/agents/*.agent.md ~/.copilot/agents/

# Copy skills (each skill is a folder with SKILL.md inside)
cp -r accessibility-agents/.github/skills/* ~/.copilot/skills/
```

Or use the installer with the `--cli` flag:

```bash
bash install.sh --global --cli
```

### Using Agents in Copilot CLI

**List available agents:**

```bash
/agent
```

**Use an agent directly:**

```bash
# Select from the agent picker
/agent

# Or mention the agent in your prompt
Use the accessibility-lead agent to review this component

# Or specify via command line
copilot --agent=accessibility-lead --prompt "Review the accessibility of src/components/"
```

**List and manage skills:**

```bash
/skills list        # Show available skills
/skills             # Toggle skills on/off interactively
/skills info        # Show skill details and locations
/skills reload      # Reload skills after adding new ones
```

### Tool Compatibility

Copilot CLI uses standardized tool aliases. The accessibility agents include tool declarations that work across platforms:

| CLI Tool | Purpose | Agent Usage |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `read` | Read file contents | View source files for review |
| `edit` | Edit files | Apply accessibility fixes |
| `search` | Search files | Find accessibility patterns |
| `execute` | Run shell commands | Run axe-core scans |
| `agent` | Delegate to sub-agents | Coordinate specialist agents |
| `web` | Fetch web content | Retrieve WCAG documentation |

### Troubleshooting

**Agents not appearing in `/agent` list:**

1. Verify files are in correct location: `.github/agents/*.agent.md` or `~/.copilot/agents/*.agent.md`
2. Ensure workspace is trusted (CLI prompts on first use)
3. Check file naming: must end in `.agent.md`
4. Restart CLI session after adding new agents

**Skills not loading:**

1. Verify skill structure: `.github/skills/skill-name/SKILL.md`
2. Check SKILL.md has required YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`
3. Run `/skills reload` to refresh after adding new skills
4. Use `/skills info` to check where skills are loaded from

**"Tool not found" errors:**

- Agents may reference VS Code-specific tools that CLI doesn't have. This is expected behavior.
- CLI ignores unknown tool names gracefully. Core functionality (read, edit, search) works.

**Agent not behaving as expected:**

1. Enable debug logging: `/troubleshoot` (requires VS Code 1.112+ settings)
2. Check that instructions file is being loaded: `/instructions`
3. Verify workspace trust is granted for the project

For detailed troubleshooting, see [Copilot CLI Troubleshooting Guide](guides/copilot-cli-troubleshooting.md).

### Differences from VS Code Extension

| Feature | VS Code Extension | Copilot CLI |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| Agent picker | Dropdown in Chat panel | `/agent` command |
| Skills | Auto-loaded based on context | `/skills` to manage |
| Tools | Extension-specific (runSubagent, getDiagnostics) | Standard aliases (read, edit, search, agent) |
| Debugging | Agent Debug Panel | `/troubleshoot` command |
| Global agents | VS Code user profile folder | `~/.copilot/agents/` |
| Instructions | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | Same (auto-loaded) |
| Model selection | Settings/dropdown | `/model` command |

### CLI-Specific Tips

**Autopilot mode for batch scans:**

Press `Shift+Tab` to cycle to Autopilot mode for hands-free accessibility audits:

```bash
# Start in autopilot mode
copilot --experimental
# Then Shift+Tab to cycle to autopilot
```

**Resume sessions:**

```bash
# Resume last session
copilot --continue

# List and select a session
/resume
```

**Include specific files:**

```bash
# Use @ to include files in context
Explain @src/components/Modal.tsx for accessibility issues
```

## Claude Desktop Setup

This is for the **Claude Desktop app** (the standalone application).

### What is the .mcpb Extension?

The `.mcpb` file (MCP Bundle) is Claude Desktop's extension format. It is a packaged bundle that adds tools and prompts directly into the Claude Desktop interface. You download one file, double-click it, and Claude Desktop installs it.

The A11y Agent Team extension adds:

**Tools** (Claude can call these automatically while working):

- **check_contrast**: Calculate WCAG contrast ratios between two hex colors
- **get_accessibility_guidelines**: Get detailed WCAG AA guidelines for specific component types
- **check_heading_structure**: Analyze HTML for heading hierarchy issues
- **check_link_text**: Scan HTML for ambiguous link text
- **check_form_labels**: Validate form inputs have proper label associations
- **generate_vpat**: Generate a VPAT 2.5 / Accessibility Conformance Report template
- **run_axe_scan**: Run axe-core against a live URL and return violations
- **scan_office_document**: Scan DOCX, XLSX, PPTX files for accessibility issues
- **scan_pdf_document**: Scan PDFs for PDF/UA conformance
- **extract_document_metadata**: Extract document properties and metadata
- **batch_scan_documents**: Scan multiple documents in one operation

**Prompts** (you select these from the prompt menu):

- **Full Accessibility Audit**: Comprehensive WCAG 2.1 AA review
- **ARIA Review**: Focused review of ARIA roles, states, and properties
- **Modal/Dialog Review**: Focus trapping, focus return, escape behavior
- **Color Contrast Review**: Color choices checked against AA requirements
- **Keyboard Navigation Review**: Tab order, focus management, skip links
- **Live Region Review**: Dynamic content announcements and screen reader compatibility

### Prerequisites

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Always use the **latest version** of Claude Desktop. Anthropic regularly adds new MCP capabilities, tool improvements, and features that enhance extension functionality.

**Required:**

- [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) app installed (latest version)
- A Claude subscription (Pro plan or higher)

**Version Checks:**

```bash
# Check Claude Desktop: About → Version (or Help menu)
```

**How to Update:**

```bash
# Claude Desktop auto-updates by default, or check Help → Check for Updates
# Update Accessibility Agents
cd accessibility-agents
git pull origin main
bash update.sh
```

### How to Install

1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/Community-Access/accessibility-agents/releases)
2. Download the latest `a11y-agent-team.mcpb` file
3. Double-click the file (or drag it into Claude Desktop)
4. Claude Desktop will open an install dialog. Click Install
5. Done. The tools and prompts are now available in every conversation

### How to Use in Claude Desktop

**Tools activate automatically.** When you ask Claude to review code or build a component, it can call `check_contrast` and `get_accessibility_guidelines` on its own.

**Prompts are available from the prompt menu.** Click the prompt picker (or type `/`) and you will see the six review prompts listed.

### Building from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Community-Access/accessibility-agents.git
cd accessibility-agents/mcp-server
npm install

# HTTP mode (recommended)
npm start
# → http://127.0.0.1:3100/mcp

# stdio mode (for Claude Desktop mcp.json)
node stdio.js
```

Configure Claude Desktop to use the HTTP server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "a11y-agent-team": {
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:3100/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

See [mcp-server/README.md](../mcp-server/README.md) for full setup and deployment options.

## Codex CLI Setup

This is for **OpenAI Codex CLI** (the terminal coding agent).

### How It Works

Codex CLI reads `AGENTS.md` files from the project directory tree automatically. The accessibility rules are loaded into every session — no extra flags or configuration needed. When Codex works on any UI task, it applies the WCAG 2.2 AA rules from the AGENTS.md file before considering the work done.

Accessibility Agents keeps that stable AGENTS.md baseline, and now also includes an experimental TOML-based role layer for newer Codex builds that support multi-agent workflows. The experimental roles are optional and do not replace the baseline rules.

### Prerequisites

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Always use the **latest version** of Codex CLI. New OpenAI model capabilities, API changes, and bug fixes may affect agent behavior.

**Required:**

- [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) installed and working (latest version)
- An OpenAI API key configured

**Version Checks:**

```bash
codex --version    # Should show latest stable release
```

**How to Update:**

```bash
# Update Codex CLI (follow official documentation)
# Update Accessibility Agents
cd accessibility-agents
git pull origin main
bash update.sh
```

### Installation

#### Via the Installer (Recommended)

```bash
# Project install with Codex support
bash install.sh --project --codex

# Global install with Codex support
bash install.sh --global --codex
```

The interactive installer also prompts for Codex support if you do not pass the flag. Codex installs include the stable `.codex/AGENTS.md` baseline and, when available, the experimental `.codex/config.toml` plus `.codex/roles/*.toml` files.

#### One-Liner

```bash
# Install globally with Codex support
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Community-Access/accessibility-agents/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --global --codex
```

#### Manual Setup

```bash
# For project install
mkdir -p .codex/roles
cp path/to/accessibility-agents/.codex/AGENTS.md .codex/AGENTS.md
cp path/to/accessibility-agents/.codex/config.toml .codex/config.toml
cp path/to/accessibility-agents/.codex/roles/*.toml .codex/roles/

# For global install
mkdir -p ~/.codex/roles
cp path/to/accessibility-agents/.codex/AGENTS.md ~/.codex/AGENTS.md
cp path/to/accessibility-agents/.codex/config.toml ~/.codex/config.toml
cp path/to/accessibility-agents/.codex/roles/*.toml ~/.codex/roles/
```

For project installs, commit `.codex/AGENTS.md`, `.codex/config.toml`, and `.codex/roles/` to your repo so the baseline rules and experimental role definitions travel with the project together.

### Using Codex with Accessibility Rules

Once installed, the rules apply automatically. Just use Codex normally:

```bash
codex "Build a login form"
codex "Add a modal dialog to the settings page"
codex "Create a data table for the analytics dashboard"
```

Codex will apply the accessibility rules from AGENTS.md to all UI code it generates. The experimental role files add narrower specialist passes when you want them, but the baseline still does the always-on guardrail work.

For the current role list, install details, and limitations, see [Experimental Codex Multi-Agent Roles](guides/codex-experimental-multi-agent.md).

### Removing

```bash
bash uninstall.sh          # Interactive — detects and removes Codex support
bash uninstall.sh --project  # Non-interactive project uninstall
bash uninstall.sh --global   # Non-interactive global uninstall
```

## Gemini CLI Setup

This is for **Google Gemini CLI** (the terminal coding agent).

### How It Works

Gemini CLI uses an extension system with skills. Each accessibility agent is packaged as a skill (`SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter) inside the `a11y-agents` extension. The `GEMINI.md` context file provides always-on WCAG AA enforcement rules that load into every conversation, similar to how `CLAUDE.md` works for Claude Code.

The extension includes 80 agent skills covering all accessibility domains plus 18 knowledge domain skills for reference data (WCAG mappings, severity scoring, help URLs).

### Prerequisites

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Always use the **latest version** of Gemini CLI. Google adds new model capabilities, API improvements, and features that enhance agent functionality.

**Required:**

- [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) installed and working (latest version)
- A Gemini API key configured

**Version Checks:**

```bash
gemini --version    # Should show latest stable release
```

**How to Update:**

```bash
# Update Gemini CLI (follow official documentation)
# Update Accessibility Agents
cd accessibility-agents
git pull origin main
bash update.sh
```

### Installation

#### Via the Installer (Recommended)

```bash
# Project install with Gemini support
bash install.sh --project --gemini

# Global install with Gemini support
bash install.sh --global --gemini
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

The interactive installer also prompts for Gemini support.

#### One-Liner

```bash
# Install globally with Gemini support
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Community-Access/accessibility-agents/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --global --gemini
```

#### Manual Setup

```bash
# For project install
cp -r .gemini/extensions/a11y-agents/ /path/to/project/.gemini/extensions/a11y-agents/

# For global install
cp -r .gemini/extensions/a11y-agents/ ~/.gemini/extensions/a11y-agents/
```

For project installs, commit `.gemini/extensions/a11y-agents/` to your repo so the rules travel with the project.

### Using Gemini with Accessibility Skills

Once installed, skills are available automatically. Just use Gemini normally:

```bash
gemini "Build a login form"
gemini "Add a modal dialog to the settings page"
gemini "Create a data table for the analytics dashboard"
```

Gemini will load the `GEMINI.md` context file and apply WCAG AA rules to all UI code. Individual skills provide deeper domain-specific knowledge when triggered by relevant prompts.

### What's Included

- **gemini-extension.json** -- Extension manifest
- **GEMINI.md** -- Always-on accessibility context with decision matrix and non-negotiable standards
- **skills/** -- 98 skills total (80 agent skills + 18 knowledge domains)

### Removing

Delete the extension directory:

```bash
# Project install
rm -rf .gemini/extensions/a11y-agents/

# Global install
rm -rf ~/.gemini/extensions/a11y-agents/
```
