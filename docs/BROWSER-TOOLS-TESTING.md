### Steps:

1. **Create test page with unusual content:**
   - Animated element (colors change)
   - Element partially off-screen
   - Very low opacity
   -Canvas/SVG with dynamic content

2. **Run web-accessibility-wizard:**
   ```
   @web-accessibility-wizard audit test page with animated content
   ```

3. **Wizard identifies contrast issue on animated button:**

4. **Browser verification captures screenshot:**
   - Screenshot is captured ✓
   - Visual analyzer attempts to extract colors
   - Fails because element is animated (colors inconsistent)
   - Expected response:
     ```
     ⚠️ Visual analysis couldn't verify the complete fix.
     The animated button made color analysis unreliable.
     
     Workaround: Open DevTools and manually inspect:
     - Right-click button → Inspect
     - Look for: computed color property
     - Check against background color
     
     Screenshot captured for your reference.
     ```

5. **Observe:**
   - Screenshot is still saved even analysis failed ✓
   - User gets fallback instructions ✓
   - Verification status: "NEEDS_REVIEW" ✓
