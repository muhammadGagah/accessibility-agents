> **AI and automated tools are not perfect.** They miss things, make mistakes, and cannot replace testing with real screen readers and assistive technology. Always verify with VoiceOver, NVDA, JAWS, and keyboard-only navigation. This tooling is a helpful starting point, not a substitute for real accessibility testing.

**A community-driven open-source project automating accessibility, efficiency, and productivity through AI-based agents, skills, custom instructions, and prompts.**

A sincere thanks goes out to [Taylor Arndt](https://github.com/taylorarndt) and [Jeff Bishop](https://github.com/jeffreybishop) for leading the charge in building this community project. It started because LLMs consistently forget accessibility - skills get ignored, instructions drift out of context, ARIA gets misused, focus management gets skipped, color contrast fails silently. They got tired of fighting it and built an agent team that will not let it slide. Now we want to make more magic together.

> **We want more contributors!** If you care about making software accessible to blind and low vision users, please consider [submitting a PR](CONTRIBUTING.md). Every improvement to these agents helps developers ship more inclusive software for the people who need it most.

## The Problem

AI coding tools generate inaccessible code by default. They forget ARIA rules, skip keyboard navigation, ignore contrast ratios, and produce modals that trap screen reader users. Even with skills and CLAUDE.md instructions, accessibility context gets deprioritized or dropped entirely.

## The Solution

**Accessibility Agents** provides seventy-nine specialized agents across eight teams and five platforms:

- **Web Accessibility team** - agents that enforce WCAG AA standards for web code, including i18n/RTL, WCAG AAA coverage, data visualization, email, media, web components, and performance accessibility
- **Document Accessibility team** - agents for Office (DOCX, XLSX, PPTX), PDF, EPUB, and Markdown accessibility scanning and remediation
- **GitHub Workflow team** - twenty agents that manage repositories, triage issues, review PRs, manage project boards, CI/CD workflows, security alerts, releases, notifications, and wiki pages
- **Developer Tools team** - agents for Python, wxPython, desktop accessibility, NVDA addon development, and accessibility tool building
- **Education & Standards** - screen reader simulation, WCAG 3.0 preview, WCAG AAA auditing
- **Cross-cutting** - CI/CD accessibility pipelines, compliance mapping, accessibility statements, regression detection, and orchestrators that route work across teams

All agents run on:

- **Claude Code** - Agents you invoke directly for accessibility evaluation
- **GitHub Copilot** (VS Code and CLI) - Agents + workspace instructions that ensure accessibility guidance in every conversation
- **Gemini CLI** - Skills-based extension with always-on WCAG AA context via GEMINI.md
- **Codex CLI** - Stable `.codex/AGENTS.md` baseline plus optional experimental TOML-based roles for focused accessibility passes
- **MCP Server** - HTTP-based server providing 24 accessibility scanning tools to any MCP-compatible client (Claude Desktop, VS Code, CI/CD pipelines)

## System Requirements

> ⚠️ **CRITICAL:** To remain current with Accessibility Agents and ensure proper functionality, you **must** keep all tools updated to their latest versions. New platform capabilities, API changes, accessibility features, and bug fixes directly impact agent behavior.

### Required Tools (Latest Versions)

**For GitHub Copilot (VS Code):**

- **VS Code:** Latest stable release ([Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
- **GitHub Copilot Extension:** Latest version from VS Code Marketplace
- **GitHub Copilot Chat Extension:** Latest version from VS Code Marketplace
- **Node.js:** v18.0.0 or higher (for CLI tools like axe-core)

**For Claude Code:**

- **Claude Code CLI:** Latest version ([Installation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code))
- **Claude Subscription:** Pro, Max, or Team plan

**For Gemini CLI:**

- **Gemini CLI:** Latest version ([Installation](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli))
- **Google AI Studio API Key:** Active key ([Get Started](https://ai.google.dev/))

**Operating Systems:**

- **macOS:** 10.15 (Catalina) or later
- **Linux:** Ubuntu 20.04+, Fedora 35+, or equivalent with bash 4.0+
- **Windows:** Windows 10/11 with PowerShell 5.1+ (pre-installed)

### Why Version Currency Matters

1. **Platform API Changes** - VS Code Copilot, Claude Code, and other platforms add new capabilities (tool use, context windows, model selection) that agents rely on
2. **Accessibility Features** - New platform features directly improve agent effectiveness (browser tools, screenshot analysis, DOM inspection)
3. **Bug Fixes** - Critical fixes for tool invocation, context handling, and agent orchestration
4. **Security Updates** - Important security patches for API access, authentication, and data handling
5. **WCAG Evolution** - As standards evolve (WCAG 2.2, 3.0), agents update to reflect current best practices

### Keeping Tools Updated

**Automatic Updates (Recommended):**

```bash
# Set up daily auto-updates during installation (recommended)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Community-Access/accessibility-agents/main/install.sh | bash
# Choose "Yes" when prompted for auto-updates

# Or manually enable auto-updates later
bash update.sh --auto
```

**Manual Updates:**

```bash
# Update Accessibility Agents
cd accessibility-agents
git pull origin main
bash update.sh

# Update VS Code
# Help → Check for Updates (or auto-updates if enabled in settings)

# Update GitHub Copilot Extensions
# Extensions → @installed → Click update icon next to GitHub Copilot extensions

# Update Claude Code CLI
claude code update

# Update Node.js tools
npm update -g @axe-core/cli
npm update -g pa11y
```

**Version Checks:**

```bash
# Check current versions
code --version                    # VS Code
claude code --version            # Claude Code CLI
node --version                   # Node.js
npm list -g --depth=0            # Global npm packages
```

### Compatibility Note

Accessibility Agents are tested against the **latest stable releases** of all supported platforms. While older versions may work, we cannot guarantee compatibility or support issues arising from outdated tooling. If you encounter unexpected behavior, update all tools before reporting issues.

### Authoritative Sources and Currency

This project bases platform-specific guidance on official vendor documentation and release notes, not secondary summaries.

Primary references:

- VS Code release notes: `https://code.visualstudio.com/updates`
- VS Code Copilot customization docs: `https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/custom-instructions`
- VS Code custom agents docs: `https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/custom-agents`
- VS Code prompt files docs: `https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/prompt-files`
- GitHub Copilot product docs: `https://docs.github.com/copilot`

Attribution policy:

- Platform claims in this repo should cite at least one official source link.
- New behavior tied to a specific release should include the release note URL.
- When settings keys are documented, link to the official settings/docs page where possible.

## Optional Customization

### Custom Thinking Phrases (VS Code 1.110+)

**VS Code users:** Personalize the loading text that appears while agents think with accessibility-themed phrases.

**Add to VS Code Settings (settings.json):**

```jsonc
{
  "chat.agent.thinking.phrases": {
    "mode": "append",  // Adds to default phrases
    "phrases": [
      "Checking contrast ratios...",
      "Testing with screen readers...",
      "Verifying keyboard navigation...",
      "Reviewing ARIA patterns...",
      "Scanning for accessibility barriers...",
      "Consulting WCAG 2.2..."
    ]
  }
}
```

**Options:**

- `"mode": "append"` - Adds your phrases to VS Code's default list (recommended)
- `"mode": "replace"` - Only shows your custom phrases

**Why This Matters:**

- Reinforces accessibility focus during agent work
- Reminds team members that accessibility is actively considered
- Optional fun enhancement to make wait time more engaging

**How to Add:**

1. Open VS Code Settings (Ctrl/Cmd + ,)
2. Click "Open Settings (JSON)" icon in top-right
3. Add the `chat.agent.thinking.phrases` setting
4. Reload window (Command Palette → "Developer: Reload Window")

## Quick Start

### One-liner install

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Community-Access/accessibility-agents/main/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Community-Access/accessibility-agents/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

See the full [Getting Started Guide](docs/getting-started.md) for all installation options, manual setup, global vs project install, auto-updates, and platform-specific details.

### One-liner uninstall

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Community-Access/accessibility-agents/main/uninstall.sh | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Community-Access/accessibility-agents/main/uninstall.ps1 | iex
```

The uninstaller removes all agents, config sections, assets, extensions, and auto-update tasks across every platform (Claude Code, Copilot, Codex, Gemini). If no manifest file is found, it downloads the repo to build a fallback file list so nothing is missed.

For step-by-step manual removal instructions, see [UNINSTALL.md](UNINSTALL.md).

### Safe installation — your files are never overwritten

The installer is designed to be additive and non-destructive:

- **Agent files** (`~/.claude/agents/`, `.github/agents/`) - existing files are skipped, not replaced. A message tells you which agents were skipped so you know what you already have.
- **Config files** (`copilot-instructions.md`, `copilot-review-instructions.md`, `copilot-commit-message-instructions.md`) - our content is wrapped in `<!-- a11y-agent-team: start/end -->` markers and merged into your existing file. Your content above and below the markers is always preserved. If the file does not exist, it is created.
- **Asset directories** (`skills/`, `instructions/`, `prompts/`) - copied file-by-file; files that already exist are skipped.
- **Manifest file** (`.a11y-agent-manifest`) - tracks every file we installed. The update script uses this list to ensure it only touches files we own, never user-created agents. When contributors add new agents to the repo, those files are automatically installed on next update and added to the manifest.

**Updates are equally safe** - the update script never deletes agent files. If a file is not in the manifest (meaning you created it yourself), it will not be modified or removed.

To reinstall a specific agent from scratch, delete it first and rerun the installer (or update script).

## Install from VS Code Marketplace (Coming Soon)

**GitHub Copilot users (VS Code):** A VS Code extension is in development that will allow one-click install from the Extensions marketplace. Until then, use the **one-liner install** above or the manual steps in [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md).

**What the extension will include:**

- ✅ 59 fully-integrated agents in GitHub Copilot (VS Code and CLI)
- ✅ 18 reusable accessibility skills (WCAG rules, severity scoring, scanning patterns)
- ✅ 106 custom prompts for web audits, document audits, GitHub workflows, and developer tooling
- ✅ 6 workspace instructions (automatic WCAG AA enforcement on every chat)
- ✅ 100% source citation coverage (all agents cite authoritative standards)
- ✅ Auto-update mechanism (new agents and features arrive automatically)

For other platforms (Claude Code, Gemini, Claude Desktop, Codex), see [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md).

## Source Citation Policy

Every agent follows a formal source citation policy. AI giving accessibility advice must be held to a higher standard -- wrong guidance creates real barriers for real people.

- **No source, no claim.** If an agent cannot cite an authoritative source, it explicitly flags the recommendation as experience-based.
- **Inline citations.** Every factual claim includes a link to the source.
- **Six-tier authority hierarchy.** Normative specs (WCAG, ARIA) > Informative guidance > Platform vendor docs > AT vendor docs > Peer-reviewed experts > Government/legal.
- **Machine-readable source registry.** `SOURCE_REGISTRY.json` maps every agent domain to its designated primary authorities.
- **Automated freshness checks.** A weekly GitHub Actions workflow verifies source URLs are still live and opens issues when documentation drifts.

See [CITATION_POLICY.md](.github/agents/CITATION_POLICY.md) for the full policy.

## Roadmap

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for what is planned, in progress, and shipped. Track individual items on the [roadmap issues board](https://github.com/Community-Access/accessibility-agents/issues?q=label%3Aroadmap).

## What This Does Not Cover

- Mobile native accessibility (iOS/Android). A separate agent team for that is [planned](https://github.com/Community-Access/accessibility-agents/issues/8).
- WCAG AAA compliance (agents target AA as the standard). An AAA agent is [planned](https://github.com/Community-Access/accessibility-agents/issues/12).

## Example Project

The `example/` directory contains a deliberately broken web page with 20+ intentional accessibility violations. Use it to practice with the agents and see how they catch real issues. See the [example README](example/README.md) for details.

## Contributing

This project exists because the community shows up. Every feature in v2.5 -- the NVDA Addon Specialist, the Text Quality Reviewer, the source citation policy, the wxPython screen reader documentation -- started as a community conversation. Not a roadmap item. A real person saying "this is what I need."

Whether you are a developer, accessibility specialist, screen reader user, or just someone who cares about inclusive software - there is a place for you here.

- **Found an agent gap?** [Open an issue](https://github.com/Community-Access/accessibility-agents/issues/new?template=agent_gap.yml) describing what the agent missed or got wrong.
- **Know a pattern we should catch?** Open a PR. Agent files are plain Markdown - no special tooling required.
- **Building for the blind and low vision community?** Your lived experience and domain knowledge are exactly what makes these agents better. We would love your involvement.

See the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for full details, guidelines, and how to get started.

## About This Project

**Accessibility Agents** was founded by [Taylor Arndt](https://github.com/taylorarndt) (COO at [Techopolis](https://github.com/techopolis-group)) and [Jeff Bishop](https://github.com/jeffreybishop) because accessibility is how they work, not something bolted on at the end. When AI coding tools consistently failed at accessibility, they built the team they wished existed - and opened it to the world.

This is a community project. The more perspectives, lived experiences, and domain knowledge that go into it, the better it serves the blind and low vision community. If you have ideas, open a discussion. If you have fixes, open a PR. Every contribution matters.
